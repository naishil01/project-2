This script automates the progress report generation and email dispatch process for students. It reads student performance data from an Excel sheet, generates visual summaries (attendance and test score), sends a personalized email to the parent with attached charts, and finally deletes the temporary files to keep the system clean. It uses pandas for data processing, matplotlib for charting, and smtplib with MIME for secure, formatted email communication via Gmail
